# Made with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

use npm start to run. The project was made as an example of code for an interview.

If this were a real project I would rather opt for TypeScript over JavaScript however for the size and complexity of the task I felt that the overhead of typing would be cumbersome as opposed to useful.

Similarly, I would break down the CSS into modules to separate it out and avoid conflicting selectors.

Lastly, I would introduce context or a third party state management library to store the login information to share between components without prop drilling (assuming no real backend in which case I would probably use cookies with a JWT or similar)
